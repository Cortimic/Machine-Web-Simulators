# Web-Based Machine Simulators

Below are links to three web simulators I helped develop to during my Software Engineering Internship at LECO during the summer of 2025. These simulators replicate the functionality and UI of real machines which customers and sales teams to interact with the product without needing physical hardware.

- **CX Simulator** – [View](https://cxsim.lecosoftware.com)

## Contributions

- Connected existing UI elements to simulator logic that mimics machine behavior
- Ensured feature accuracy by referencing machine manuals and source code to match simulator behavior with existing machines
- Collaborated with sales and product staff to align features with user needs
